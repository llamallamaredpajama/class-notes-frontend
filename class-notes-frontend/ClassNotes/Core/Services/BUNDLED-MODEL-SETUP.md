# WhisperKit Bundled Model Setup

## Overview
The WhisperKit medium model has been successfully pre-bundled with the app to avoid runtime downloads.

## What Was Done

1. **Downloaded the Medium Model**
   - Used the WhisperKit CLI to download the `openai_whisper-medium` model
   - Model size: ~1.47GB (592MB AudioEncoder + 881MB TextDecoder)

2. **Added Model to Xcode Project**
   - Created `WhisperKitModels` folder in the project
   - Copied the `openai_whisper-medium` folder containing:
     - AudioEncoder.mlmodelc (592MB)
     - TextDecoder.mlmodelc (881MB)
     - MelSpectrogram.mlmodelc (372KB)
     - Configuration files

3. **Updated WhisperKitService**
   - Added `initializeWhisperKitWithBundledModel()` method
   - This method loads models from the app bundle instead of downloading

4. **Updated Example View**
   - Changed to use bundled model initialization
   - Set default model to "medium"

## Important Notes

### When Adding to Xcode
When you add the `WhisperKitModels` folder to Xcode:
1. ✅ Select "Create folder references" (NOT "Create groups")
2. ✅ Check "Copy items if needed"
3. ✅ Add to your app target

### Usage
```swift
// Initialize with bundled medium model
await whisperService.initializeWhisperKitWithBundledModel(modelName: "medium")

// Or use default (which is medium)
await whisperService.initializeWhisperKitWithBundledModel()
```

### Model Performance
The medium model offers:
- Good balance between accuracy and speed
- Suitable for most transcription tasks
- Works well on modern iOS/macOS devices

### App Size Impact
Adding the medium model increases app size by approximately 1.5GB. Consider:
- Using App Thinning if targeting multiple device types
- Providing a smaller model (like "base") as fallback
- Implementing on-demand resources if needed
