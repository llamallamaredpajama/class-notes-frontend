# Generated Proto Files

This directory contains the generated protobuf and gRPC code for ClassNotes.

## Generated Files

- `classnotes_service.pb.swift` - Protocol buffer message definitions
- `classnotes_service.grpc.swift` - gRPC client code

## Usage in Xcode

### As a Local Swift Package (Recommended)

1. In Xcode, go to File â†’ Add Package Dependencies
2. Click "Add Local..."
3. Navigate to and select the GeneratedProtos folder
4. Click "Add Package"
5. Import in your code: `import GeneratedProtos`

### Direct File Import (Not Recommended)

1. Drag the Sources folder into your Xcode project
2. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is UNCHECKED
3. Add to your target

## Important Notes

- These files are generated OUTSIDE of Xcode to avoid build-time conflicts
- Do NOT add proto generation as a build phase in Xcode
- To regenerate, run: `./Scripts/generate-protos-direct.sh`
- The generated code uses gRPC-Swift v2 APIs correctly
