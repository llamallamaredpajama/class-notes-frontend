# Apple Sign In Setup Guide

This guide covers the complete setup for Apple Sign In functionality in the Class Notes app.

## ‚úÖ Code Changes Completed

The following code changes have been implemented:

1. **AppleSignInServiceProtocol.swift** - Protocol definition for Apple Sign In service
2. **AppleSignInService.swift** - Full implementation with real and mock services
3. **AuthenticationServiceProtocol.swift** - Updated to include `signInWithApple()` method
4. **AuthenticationService.swift** - Updated to handle Apple Sign In authentication
5. **AuthenticationViewModel.swift** - Added `signInWithApple()` method
6. **ClassNotesSignInView.swift** - Updated UI with Apple Sign In button
7. **KeychainService.swift** - Extended with Apple Sign In specific storage methods
8. **ClassNotesApp.swift** - Updated to create Apple Sign In service
9. **ClassNotes.entitlements** - Created entitlements file with Apple Sign In capability

## üîß Xcode Configuration Required

### 1. Add Apple Sign In Capability
1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select your app target
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Click **+ Capability**
5. Search for and add **"Sign in with Apple"**

### 2. Configure Entitlements File
1. Ensure the `ClassNotes.entitlements` file is added to your target
2. Verify it contains:
   ```xml
   <key>com.apple.developer.applesignin</key>
   <array>
       <string>Default</string>
   </array>
   <key>keychain-access-groups</key>
   <array>
       <string>$(AppIdentifierPrefix)com.classnotes.app</string>
   </array>
   ```

### 3. Apple Developer Console Setup
1. Log in to [Apple Developer Console](https://developer.apple.com)
2. Go to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**
3. Select your App ID
4. Enable **Sign in with Apple** capability
5. Configure domains and email sources if needed

## üì± Testing

### Simulator Testing
- Uses `MockAuthenticationService` with simulated Apple Sign In
- Logs: "üçé Mock Authentication: Simulating Apple Sign-In..."
- Creates mock Apple user with test data

### Physical Device Testing
- Uses real `AppleSignInService` 
- Integrates with actual Apple ID authentication
- Stores credentials securely in keychain

## üîê Security Features

### Keychain Storage
- Apple user ID stored securely
- Email stored (only provided on first sign-in)
- Full name components stored (only provided on first sign-in)
- Identity token stored for backend authentication

### Credential State Checking
- Automatically checks if Apple ID authorization is still valid
- Clears stored data if authorization is revoked
- Handles credential transfer scenarios

## üé® User Interface

### Sign In Flow
1. App displays both Apple and Google Sign In buttons
2. Apple Sign In button appears first (Apple's recommended practice)
3. "or" divider between options
4. Consistent styling with app theme
5. Proper accessibility support

### Button Styling
- Apple Sign In: Black background with white text/logo
- Automatically adapts to dark/light mode
- Consistent with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines

## üöÄ Usage

Users can now:
1. Sign in with Apple ID on first launch
2. Subsequent launches use stored credentials
3. App automatically validates credential state
4. Seamless sign out clears all Apple Sign In data

## üîç Debugging

### Logs to Look For
- Simulator: "üì± Running on Simulator - Using Mock Authentication Service"
- Device: "üì± Running on Physical Device - Using Real Authentication Service"
- Apple Sign In: "üçé Mock Authentication: Simulating Apple Sign-In..."
- Success: "‚úÖ Mock Authentication: Apple user signed in successfully"

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Capability**: Ensure "Sign in with Apple" is added in Xcode
2. **Entitlements**: Verify entitlements file is properly configured
3. **Bundle ID**: Ensure bundle ID matches what's configured in Developer Console
4. **Provisioning Profile**: May need to regenerate after adding capability
